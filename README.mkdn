# ATTRIBUTES

## group\_by\_author

Whether to group commit messages by their author. This is the only way previous
versions did it. Defaults to no, and \[ Anne Author \] is appended to the commit
message.

Defaults to off.

## show\_author\_email

Author email is probably just noise for most people, but turn this on if you
want to show it \[ Anne Author <anne@author.com> \]

Defaults to off.

## show\_author

Whether to show authors at all. Turning this off also
turns off grouping by author and author emails.

Defaults to on.

## `tag_regexp`

A regexp string which will be used to match git tags to find releases. If your
release tags are not compliant with [CPAN::Changes::Spec](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Changes::Spec), you can use a
capture group. It will be used as the version in place of the full tag name.

Defaults to '^\\d+\\.\\d+$'

## `file_name`

The name of the changelog file.

Defaults to 'Changes'.

## `preamble`

Block of text at the beginning of the changelog.

Defaults to 'Changelog for $dist\_name'

## `copy_to_root`

When true, the generated changelog will be copied into the root folder where it
can be committed (possiby automatically by [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Commit](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::Commit))

Defaults to true.

## `edit_changelog`

When true, the generated changelog will be opened in an editor to allow manual
editing.

Defaults to false.
